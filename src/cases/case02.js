/**
 * CASE 02 — "A LONG WAY DOWN"
 *
 * A step harder than Case 01. Six tables, five suspects. Solving it needs the
 * player to JOIN across several tables and reason over more moving parts:
 *   - an elevator log (who rode to which floor, when),
 *   - phone tower pings (where each suspect's phone actually was),
 *   - purchase records (who bought the sabotaged item),
 *   - plus alibis and forensics.
 *
 * The victim, Celeste Bloom, fell from her 7th-floor gallery balcony. Ruled a
 * possible suicide — but the balcony railing bracket was loosened (sabotage),
 * and the data exposes the one suspect who: (a) rode the elevator to Floor 7 in
 * the fall window while claiming to be off-site, (b) whose phone pinged the
 * gallery's tower at that time, and (c) bought a hex wrench matching the tool
 * marks on the bracket.
 *
 * Every step is provable with SQL; nothing is guessable.

    report: `Celeste Bloom fell from the seventh-floor balcony of her own gallery during a private viewing and was found in the atrium below at 21:07. The coroner's window for the fall is 20:40 to 21:00.

At first glance it read as a jump — the balcony was empty, the door to it unlocked. But the maintenance team found the railing's corner BRACKET had been deliberately loosened: fresh tool marks from a HEX WRENCH, and two bolts backed most of the way out. Someone wanted that railing to give.

The building is instrumented. The service elevator logs every trip and floor. Every phone in range pings the nearest cell tower, and the gallery sits under the "Wharf-7" tower. And the hardware shop two blocks over keeps card receipts.

Five guests had a reason to want Celeste gone, and each gave a statement about where they were at 20:50. One of those statements is a lie the records don't support.`,
