/**
 * CASE 04 — "DEAD SIGNAL"
 *
 * A step harder than Case 03. Seven tables, five suspects, and a piece of
 * FABRICATED evidence the player must disprove before the real question even
 * makes sense:
 *
 *   - A text "from the victim" at 02:14 fixes everyone's attention after 2 AM,
 *     but tower_pings show his phone left the network at 01:50 for good.
 *     Proving that requires an aggregate with an alias (MAX(ping_time) AS
 *     last_ping), not a plain filter.
 *   - messages carries a `sent_via` column: every genuine text went out from
 *     the handset — the 02:14 one went through a cloud relay.
 *   - device_registry shows whose device was quietly paired to the victim's
 *     cloud account two days earlier (the relay's origin).
 *   - alibis all cover the FAKE window (post-02:00); two suspects have gaps in
 *     the coroner's REAL window, so the player must triangulate with
 *     tower_pings and cctv_sightings (joined through vehicle plates) to pick
 *     the right one.
 *
 * The difficulty is the misdirection: the data disproves its own headline fact.
 * Everything is still provable with SQL — no guessing.

    report: `Jonah Reyes was found at his desk on the morning of May 2nd, dead from a single blow to the back of the head. He was mid-way through a story someone did not want printed.

At 02:14 his phone texted his editor: "Can't sleep — still polishing the draft. More tomorrow." Everyone anchored their statements to that text. It proves he was alive after two. Except it proves nothing: the carrier's records show his handset last touched a cell tower at 01:50 and never came back on the network. Dead phones don't type.

Every message before that one left the handset itself. Check HOW the 02:14 text was sent — and check the device registry for what else was recently paired to Jonah's cloud account.

The coroner puts the killing between 01:20 and 01:55. Five people orbit this story. Their alibis are all watertight — after 02:00. For the window that actually matters, the towers, the street cameras, and the registry will tell you who is lying.`,
