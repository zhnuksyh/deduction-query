/**
 * Trailer audio: reuses the game's own procedural SFX engine and the looping
 * music track, so the trailer sounds exactly like the game. Nothing new is
 * synthesized or bundled — we just drive the existing engines on a schedule.
 *
 * `playSound(name)` fires the same Web-Audio effects the game uses (run,
 * success, unlock, stamp, paper, solved, click...). `updateMusic` streams the
 * same MP3. Both are gated behind a user gesture by the browser; the trailer's
 * play button is that gesture.
